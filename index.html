                            Gold Slimes are among the rarest and most valuable slimes on the Far, Far Range, known 
                            for their shimmering golden bodies and quick movements. They cannot be captured in a 
                            corral, but when hit with food or other resources, they drop highly valuable gold plorts 
                            that sell for a premium. However, they vanish instantly if touched or if the player takes 
                            too long, making them a challenging and exciting find for any rancher.

                        <p>
                            Pink Slimes are the most common and friendly slimes, easily found in almost every area 
                            of the ranching world. They are unique in that they will eat absolutely anything, which 
                            makes feeding them simple and perfect for beginners. Although their plorts are not worth 
                            much, their versatility and abundance make them essential for early-game ranching and 
                            combining with other slime types.

                        <p>
                            Rock Slimes are sturdy, blue-colored slimes with a crown of sharp, rocky spikes that give 
                            them a distinctive look. When agitated or startled, they roll into a spinning ball, which 
                            can injure the player if not approached carefully. They primarily eat vegetables, especially 
                            Heart Beets, and their rock plorts are a steady and valuable source of income.

                            Rad Slimes are glowing green slimes that emit a constant field of radiation around them, 
                            which can harm the player if they stay too close for too long. They thrive in areas rich 
                            with radioactive energy and prefer eating vegetables, with Oca Oca being their favorite 
                            food. Despite the danger, their rad plorts are highly profitable and are used to craft 
                            advanced gadgets and upgrades.

                            The Lab is a high-tech underground facility on the ranch where players can unlock the 
                            power of science to create advanced gadgets. Using the Fabricator and Refinery, ranchers 
                            can combine plorts and resources to craft teleporters, drones, and other powerful tools to 
                            improve exploration and efficiency. This area opens up deeper gameplay by encouraging 
                            resource management, experimentation, and long-term planning.
